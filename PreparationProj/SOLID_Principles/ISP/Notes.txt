we have interface IprintTask Which contains bellow method
  bool PrintContent(string content);
        bool ScanContent(string content);
        bool FaxContent(string content);
        bool PhotoCopyContent(string content);


        and we have printer class HpLaserJet which perform all the above task

        Note: But problem is we have another printer CannonMG2470 will not perform some of the above task
        Like CannonMG2470 will not perform Fax Functionality but IprintTask EnForceing this is the problem to CannonMG2470

        To Avoid this we have to create Seperate Interface
