struct
--------------
0- structs are value type
1 - structs are implicitly sealed, they cannot be inherited.
2 - struct cant inherit from other struct/class, cant implement interface,  and it canot be a base of other class
3 - structs cannot have a default constructor or a destructor
4- Structs can be instantiated without using a new operator and stored in stack.
5 - structs cannot be abstact type they are implicitly sealed
6 - struct member cannot be protected or protected internals.
7 - A struct can be used as a nullable type and can be assigned a null value.
8- Each variable in struct contains its own copy of data(except in ref and out parameter variable) and any 
operation on one variable can not effect another variable.

class
-----------
1 - classes are reference type
2 - class can inherit from other class, it can be base for other class, it can implement interface
3- we can create object (stored in heap)
4- Classes can contain constructor or destructor.
5- The data member of a class can be protected.
6- Function member of the class can be virtual or abstract.
7- Two variable of class can contain the reference of the same object and any operation
on one variable can affect another variable.
