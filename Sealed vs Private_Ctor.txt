Sealed Class
--------------------
1 - prevents all kind of inheritance (reason for why singletone class should be sealed)





private ctor
---------------
1- prevents external class inheritance
2- nested class inheritance is possiable

Note: if we are using sealed class then why we need private ctor in singletone class ?
sealed will prevent inheritance but it will not use for instantiation (ctor is used for instantiation)
